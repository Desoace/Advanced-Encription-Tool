#DESCRIPTION 


The Advanced Encryption Tool is a sophisticated cryptographic application that provides multiple encryption algorithms for securing sensitive data through both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. Built on Python's cryptography library, this tool implements five distinct encryption algorithms each serving different security needs and use cases. AES-256-CBC provides standard block cipher encryption with initialization vectors and PKCS7 padding, suitable for general-purpose file encryption. AES-256-GCM offers authenticated encryption with built-in integrity verification, preventing both unauthorized decryption and tampering. Fernet encryption provides a simpler high-level interface with built-in versioning and timestamp metadata. RSA-2048 enables asymmetric encryption using public and private key pairs, implementing hybrid encryption for large files by encrypting a symmetric key with RSA and the actual data with AES. ChaCha20-Poly1305 offers a modern alternative to AES with authenticated encryption particularly efficient on devices without hardware AES acceleration. The tool implements secure key derivation using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations and 32-byte salts, ensuring passwords are properly stretched to create encryption keys. File encryption preserves metadata including original filenames and encryption timestamps within the encrypted file structure, allowing proper restoration upon decryption. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for scenarios like incorrect passwords, corrupted files, and missing keys. A secure deletion feature overwrites files multiple times with random data and zeros before deletion, preventing forensic recovery. The tool provides both an interactive menu-driven interface for ease of use and command-line arguments for automation and scripting. RSA key generation includes options for password-protecting private keys with user-specified passphrases. The benchmarking feature allows performance comparison between algorithms with different data sizes. All encrypted data is properly formatted with clear structure including metadata length indicators, JSON metadata, and the encrypted payload. The tool emphasizes security best practices including proper random number generation, secure key storage recommendations, and clear warnings about password loss implications. This comprehensive encryption tool serves multiple use cases from securing personal files to establishing encrypted communication channels through public key cryptography.
